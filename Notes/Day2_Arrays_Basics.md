# Day 2 – Arrays Basics

Definition:
Array is a collection of elements stored in continuous memory locations.

Operations and Time Complexity:

Access → O(1)
Update → O(1)
Search (unsorted) → O(n)
Insert at end → O(1)
Insert at beginning → O(n)
Delete first → O(n)
Delete last → O(1)

Important Concept:
Shifting elements = O(n)
No shifting = O(1)
